                <p> <strong> <span class="text--lead-in">I always have a passion</span>  </strong> for cooking and sharing food. 
                    As technology has brought people together, I think food has the same power too! 
                </p>

                <p>I love to try out different recipes apart from our authentic Indian recipes. 
                    I do lot of 'food fusion', which means I mix and match cross cultural ingredients 
                    from different cultures to create my own recipes. Most of the time they turn out to be great, 
                    as I cook with my intuition.
                    </p>

                <p>I cook and share my home cooked meal during a potluck or sometimes at my work place too. I think I have made lot of 
                    friends by sharing my home cooked foodðŸ˜œ
                    </p>
                <p>Lot of ideas of course I from the internet and You Tube.
                        Back in India, I remember when I was a teenager, it was totally a different game. 
                        We mostly used to have family recipes and we had recipe books. Sometimes neighbors used to share a recipe via a handwritten note. 
                       </p>
                <img = src = "image/image1.jpg" class = "image1" />  
                <p>But today, with the privilege of having access to the internet over a phone, 
                    during leisure time I can just look over a unique recipe and tryout at home. 
                    </p>
                <p> <strong> <span class = "text--lead-in"> Today, I am going to direct you to </span> </strong>  two authentic 
                    Indian recipes, one from YouTube and the other from a website, Indian barbecue chicken known as 'Tandoori Chicken' and a Indian milk fudge dessert called as 'Peda'. 
                    </p>
                <p>Hope you will try and enjoy them at home and you may contact me with any questions.</p>
